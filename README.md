# Grocery Booking API

The Grocery Booking API is a backend service designed to manage grocery items, user accounts, orders, and order items. It provides endpoints for administrators to manage inventory and for users to view available items and place orders.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Hibernate
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database (for demonstration purposes)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or later
- Maven

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grocery-booking-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd grocery-booking-api
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Usage

The API provides the following endpoints:

- **Admin Endpoints**:
  - `/api/admin/grocery/items`: CRUD operations for managing grocery items.
- **User Endpoints**:
  - `/api/user/grocery/items`: View available grocery items.
  - `/api/user/orders`: Place an order for multiple grocery items.

### Database Configuration

The project uses an H2 in-memory database by default for demonstration purposes. You can modify the `application.properties` file to configure a different database.

### Project Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code.
  - `com.example.grocerybookingapi.entity`: Entity classes representing database tables.
  - `com.example.grocerybookingapi.repository`: Spring Data JPA repositories.
  - `com.example.grocerybookingapi.service`: Service classes implementing business logic.
  - `com.example.grocerybookingapi.controller`: Controllers defining API endpoints.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains application properties and configuration files.
